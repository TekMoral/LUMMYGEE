- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Blissbay** — an ambitious e-commerce platform designed to replicate and improve upon 75% of JUMIA’s core features. From advanced product filtering and seamless cart experiences to secure user authentication and vendor management, Blissbay is a full-scale, scalable solution built with modern web technologies. My goal is to demonstrate what’s possible with the right stack, solid architecture, and a strong developer mindset.


### 🎓 Mentorship
I offer mentorship for beginners and career-switchers who are serious about learning full-stack development. I help students go from complete beginner to professional developers.
